This consists of a scroll-driven interactive 3D card experience.

## How to View
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main entry point.
- `styles.css`: Styling for the 3D scene and scroll layout.
- `script.js`: Logic for card generation, scroll interaction, and hover effects.
- `assets/home-page-cards/`: Folder containing the card images.

## Features
- **3D Card Table**: Cards are fanned out on a virtual table surface.
- **Scroll Interaction**: Scrolling down causes the cards to "raise up" and straighten for easier viewing.
- **Interactive Hover**: Hovering over a card while raised pops it out of the stack for selection.
- **Navigation**: Clicking a card simulates navigation to that category.
